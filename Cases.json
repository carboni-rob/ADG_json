Erskine cares for over 1000 reasidents each year in four care homes, provding veterans with the companionship of like-minded people. In May 2017 we introduced the concept of a novel activity volunteering programme into Erskine care homes. Volunteers and residents will collaborate and co-create low tech innovative solutions to meet design briefs for assistive products using corrugated cardboard. We anticipate that these activities based around problem solving, innovation, creative thinking and making will un-tap and harness training and expertise acquired during residents' (and volunteers') time in service and subsequent work life. Many residents do not have the strenght or mobility to hold books while reading. Tom (94 years old) is making a book rest from a cardboard tray from a local supermarket that was used to transport boxes of tomatoes.","link":"https://www.erskine.co.uk"},{"id":"002","topImg":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxmymH9QCbtMTVpELV90SVFqVWc","title":"Working with Yogability","author":"Tracey Howe","content":"Yogability based in Scotland provides free yoga classes to children and adults with special needs, their carers and other barriers to entry. Not everyone can get into the yoga poses and we are working with Yogability to create assistive devices that can help make getting into and out of yoga positions as comfortable and easy as possible. This involves prototyping, constructing and testing.","link":"https://www.yogability.org.uk"}]
