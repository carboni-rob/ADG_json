[{"id":"001","title":"Working with Veterans","author":"Tracey Howe","content":"As one of Scotlan leading ex-Service charities, Erskine has been caring for veterans since 1916. Erskine cares for over 1000 reasidents each year in four care homes, provding veterans with the companionship of like-minded people.\\nIn May 2017 we introduced the concept of a novel activity volunteering programme into Erskine care homes. Volunteers and residents will collaborate and co-create low tech innovative solutions to meet design briefs for assistive products using corrugated cardboard.\\nWe anticipate that these activities based around problem solving, innovation, creative thinking and making will un-tap and harness training and expertise acquired during residents' (and volunteers') time in service and subsequent work life.\\nMany residents do not have the strenght or mobility to hold books while reading. Tom (94 years old) is making a book rest from a cardboard tray from a local supermarket that was used to transport boxes of tomatoes.\\nhttps://www.erskine.co.uk"},{"id":"002","title":"Working with ReactNative","author":"Roberto Carboni","content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit ammet adipisicit concretur."}]
